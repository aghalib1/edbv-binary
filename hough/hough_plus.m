function [ final_points ] = hough_plus(img, scale, min_pixels)
% Hough Transformation to detect plus

% VERY SIMPLE FIRST TRY, PLUS SHOULD NOT BE ROTATED, NOT EVEN A LITTLE

%
%Input: 
%- aleady thinned black white image, foreground is white
%- scale, how big are the plus signs to be detected, have to be integers,
%  should be the "radius" of the plus sign in pixels
%- min_pixels, minimum amount of pixels to be considered as center of a plus sign

% scale and min_pixels depend on the font style and size
% Good values for Arial, Size 20:
%
%  TO BE DONE
%

%Output:
%- Matrix containing x and y points (=center of found plus)
%  Rows = Points
%  1.Column x, 2.Column y
